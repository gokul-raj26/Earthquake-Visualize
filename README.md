## Overview

This application displays recent earthquake activity from the past 24 hours on an interactive map. Users can explore earthquake data, filter by magnitude, and get detailed information about each seismic event.

## Features

### Core Features
- **Interactive Map**: Visualize earthquakes on a world map with real-time data
- **Color-Coded Markers**: Earthquakes are color-coded by magnitude:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green: Minor earthquakes (< 3.0 magnitude)
  - ðŸŸ  Orange: Moderate earthquakes (3.0 - 5.0 magnitude)
  - ðŸ”´ Red: Major earthquakes (> 5.0 magnitude)
- **Detailed Information**: Click any earthquake marker to view:
  - Location
  - Magnitude
  - Time of occurrence
  - Link to USGS detailed report

### Enhanced Features
- **Loading Spinner**: Visual feedback while data is being fetched from the API
- **Magnitude Filter**: Dropdown menu to filter earthquakes by magnitude range:
  - All Earthquakes
  - Minor (< 3.0)
  - Moderate (3.0 - 5.0)
  - Major (> 5.0)
- **Last Updated Timestamp**: Shows when the data was last fetched
- **Refresh Button**: Manually refresh data to get the latest earthquake information
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with retry functionality
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both mobile and desktop devices

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Map Library**: Leaflet with React Leaflet
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Data Source**: [USGS Earthquake API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)

## API Reference

This application uses the USGS Earthquake API to fetch real-time seismic data:

**Endpoint**: `https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_day.geojson`

**Data Returned**:
- All earthquakes from the past 24 hours
- Magnitude, location, coordinates, time
- Direct links to detailed USGS reports

## How It Works

1. **Data Fetching**: The app fetches earthquake data from the USGS API when loaded
2. **Visualization**: Earthquakes are displayed as circular markers on an interactive map
3. **Filtering**: Users can filter earthquakes by magnitude using the dropdown menu
4. **Real-time Updates**: Click the refresh button to fetch the latest data
5. **Interaction**: Click any marker to view detailed information in a popup

## Browser Support

This application works on all modern browsers that support:
- ES6+ JavaScript
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- SVG rendering
- Fetch API
